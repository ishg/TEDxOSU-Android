After four years on campus, we are ready to take the TEDx experience to a new level this March 5, 2016 at the Mershon Auditorium. While we have many new and exciting things lined up for the year ahead, our organization still works under the mission of cultivating an event for students and city leaders who are passionate about challenging ideas and inspiring others. With this mission in mind, our team will work tirelessly to make this yearâ€™s event the best and most innovative the university has yet witnessed.
